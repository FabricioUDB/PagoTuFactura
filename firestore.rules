/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Invoice Hub application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for most data, while allowing a special 'accountant'
 * role to have read-only access to all user data for administrative purposes.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles.
 * - /users/{userId}/invoices/{invoiceId}: Stores invoices created by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/invoices/{invoiceId}/items/{itemId}: Stores invoice items associated with a specific invoice.
 *
 * Roles & Custom Claims:
 * - accountant: Users with the custom claim `role: 'accountant'` have read-access to all user, invoice, and item data.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is private and only writable by the user themselves.
 * - Accountants can read any user's data but cannot write or modify it.
 * - Listing all users is now permitted for any authenticated user for development. This should be restricted to accountants in production.
